# crystal-game

## About
The value of each of the four crystals below is assigned a random value. To win you must match your score with the target score. Your score will be added by the value of that crytal when you click it. If you win or go over the target score, the round will reset giving all of the crytals and the target score new random values.

The deployed version of my game can be found here: https://mdo352.github.io/unit-4-crystal-game/
